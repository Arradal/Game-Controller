# Game Controller for Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime
This project is the result of a 5th-semester project at Interactiondesign Aalborg University. The goal was to design and prototype a physical game controller that enhances cooperative play for the game *Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime*. The focus was on creating an inclusive experience for players with varying gaming skills.

Through iterative design, user testing, and prototyping (including 3D modeling and Arduino integration), we developed a unique cockpit-inspired controller. It features components like rotary encoders, joysticks, buttons, LED strips, and a LCD display, offering tactile and immersive interaction that aligns with the game's playful, chaotic aesthetic.

This repository contains the code related to the final prototype's functionality and implementation.
